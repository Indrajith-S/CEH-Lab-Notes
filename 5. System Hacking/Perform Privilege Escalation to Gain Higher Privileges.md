- Privilege escalation is the process of gaining more privileges than were initially acquired. Here, you can take advantage of design flaws, programming errors, bugs, and configuration oversights in the OS and software application to gain administrative access to the network and its associated applications.

- Backdoors are malicious files that contain trojan or other infectious applications that can either halt the current working state of a target machine or even gain partial or complete control over it. Here, you need to build such backdoors to gain remote access to the target system. You can send these backdoors through email, file-sharing web applications, and shared network drives, among other methods, and entice the users to execute them. Once a user executes such an application, you can gain access to their affected machine and perform activities such as keylogging and sensitive data extraction.
