- DoS and DDoS attacks have become popular, because of the easy accessibility of exploit plans and the negligible amount of brainwork required while executing them. These attacks can be very dangerous, because they can quickly consume the largest hosts on the Internet, rendering them useless. The impact of these attacks includes loss of goodwill, disabled networks, financial loss, and disabled organizations.

- In a DDoS attack, many applications pound the target browser or network with fake exterior requests that make the system, network, browser, or site slow, useless, and disabled or unavailable.

- The attacker initiates the DDoS attack by sending a command to the zombie agents. These zombie agents send a connection request to a large number of reflector systems with the spoofed IP address of the victim. The reflector systems see these requests as coming from the victim’s machine instead of as zombie agents, because of the spoofing of the source IP address. Hence, they send the requested information (response to connection request) to the victim. The victim’s machine is flooded with unsolicited responses from several reflector computers at once. This may reduce performance or may even cause the victim’s machine to shut down completely.

- As an expert ethical hacker or pen tester, you must have the required knowledge to perform DoS and DDoS attacks to be able to test systems in the target network.

- In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in auditing network resources against DoS and DDoS attacks.
