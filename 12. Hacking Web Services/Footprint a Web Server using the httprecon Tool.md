- Web applications can publish information, interact with Internet users, and establish an e-commerce or e-government presence. However, if an organization is not rigorous in configuring and operating its public website, it may be vulnerable to a variety of security threats. Although the threats in cyberspace remain largely the same as in the physical world (fraud, theft, vandalism, and terrorism), they are far more dangerous. Organizations can face monetary losses, damage to reputation, and legal action if an intruder successfully violates the confidentiality of their data.

- httprecon is a tool for advanced web server fingerprinting. This tool performs banner-grabbing attacks, status code enumeration, and header ordering analysis on its target web server.
- Navigate to **Web Server Footprinting Tools\httprecon**, right-click **httprecon.exe**, and, from the context menu, click **Run as administrator** double-click to launch the application.
- Main window of **httprecon** appears, enter the website URL that you want to footprint and select **port number (80)** in the **Target** section.
- Click **Analyze** to start analyzing the designated website.
- A **footprint** of the website appears.
- Look at the **Get existing** tab, and observe the server (**Apache**) and the server-side application (**ASP.NET**) used to develop the webpages.
- When attackers obtain this information, they research the vulnerabilities present in **ASP.NET** and **Apache** and try to exploit them, which results in either full or partial control over the web application.
- Click the **GET long request** tab, which lists all GET requests. Next, click the **Fingerprint Details** tab.
- The details displayed include the name of the protocol the website is using and its version.
- By obtaining this information, attackers can manipulate HTTP vulnerabilities in order to perform malicious activities such as sniffing over the HTTP channel, which might result in revealing sensitive data such as user credentials.
