- Pen testers must be familiar with banner grabbing techniques to monitor servers and ensure compliance and appropriate security updates. This technique also helps in locating rogue servers or determining the role of servers within a network. This lab manual helps understand and learn the banner grabbing technique using ID Serve, which allows an attacker to determine a remote target system.

- ID Serve is a simple Internet server identification utility. Following is a list of its capabilities:

	- HTTP server identification
	- Non-HTTP server identification
	- Reverse DNS lookup
- Navigate to **Web Server Footprinting Tools\ID Serve** and double-click **idserve.exe**.
- The main window of **ID Serve** appears. Click the **Server Query** tab.
- For option **1**, in the **Enter or copy/paste an Internet server URL or IP address** section, enter the URL you want to footprint.
- Click **Query the Server** to start querying the website.
- After obtaining this information, the attacker may perform a vulnerability analysis on that particular version of the web server and implement various techniques to perform exploitation.
