- ZoneAlarm FREE Firewall 2019 blocks attackers and intruders from accessing your system. It manages and monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and shields the network from hackers, malware, and other online threats that put network privacy at risk, and monitors programs for suspicious behavior spotting and stopping new attacks that bypass traditional anti-virus protection. This Firewall prevents identity theft by guarding your data, and erases your tracks allowing you to surf the web in complete privacy. Furthermore, it locks out attackers, blocks intrusions, and makes your PC invisible online. Additionally, it filters out annoying, as well as potentially dangerous, email.
