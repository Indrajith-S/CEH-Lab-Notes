- The adoption of Internet use throughout the business world has boosted network usage in general. Organizations are using various network security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and “honeypots” to protect their networks, which are the preferred targets of hackers for compromising organizations’ security. Attackers continue to find new ways to breach network security and attack these targets.

- As an expert ethical hacker or pen tester, you must possess sound knowledge of the functions, role, placement, and design implementation of IDS, IPS, firewalls, and honeypots used in the organization, as well as understand the process that the attacker has used to evade the organization’s security in order to detect their intrusion attempts.

- The labs in this module give hands-on experience in auditing a network against IDS and firewall evasion attacks.
