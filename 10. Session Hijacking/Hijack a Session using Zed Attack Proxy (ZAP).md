- Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It offers automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually. It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience, and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing.

- ZAP allows you to see all the requests you make to a web app and all the responses you receive from it. Among other things, it allows you to see AJAX calls that may not otherwise be outright visible. You can also set breakpoints, which allow you to change the requests and responses in real-time.

- Here, we will hijack a session using ZAP. You will learn how to intercept the traffic of victimsâ€™ machines with a proxy and how to view all the requests and responses from them.
