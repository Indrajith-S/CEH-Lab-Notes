- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an Internet protocol for accessing distributed directory services over a network. LDAP uses DNS (Domain Name System) for quick lookups and fast resolution of queries. A client starts an LDAP session by connecting to a DSA (Directory System Agent), typically on TCP port 389, and sends an operation request to the DSA, which then responds. BER (Basic Encoding Rules) is used to transmit information between the client and the server. One can anonymously query the LDAP service for sensitive information such as usernames, addresses, departmental details, and server names.
