- n the first step of the security assessment and penetration testing of your organization, you gather open-source information about your organization. In the second step, you collect information about open ports and services, OSes, and any configuration lapses.

- The next step for an ethical hacker or penetration tester is to probe the target network further by performing enumeration. Using various techniques, you should extract more details about the network such as lists of computers, usernames, user groups, ports, OSes, machine names, network resources, and services.

- The information gleaned from enumeration will help you to identify the vulnerabilities in your systemâ€™s security that attackers would seek to exploit. Such information could also enable attackers to perform password attacks to gain unauthorized access to information system resources.
