- SteelCentral Packet Analyzer provides a graphical console for high-speed packet analysis. It captures terabytes of packet data traversing the network, reads it, and displays it in a GUI. It can analyze multi-gigabyte recordings from locally presented trace files or on remote SteelCentral NetShark probes (physical, virtual, or embedded on SteelHeads), without a large file transfer, to identify anomalous network issues or diagnose and troubleshoot complex network and application performance issues down to the bit level.
