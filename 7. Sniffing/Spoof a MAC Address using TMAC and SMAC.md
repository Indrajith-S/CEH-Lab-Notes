- A MAC duplicating or spoofing attack involves sniffing a network for the MAC addresses of legitimate clients connected to the network. In this attack, the attacker first retrieves the MAC addresses of clients who are actively associated with the switch port. Then, the attacker spoofs their own MAC address with the MAC address of the legitimate client. Once the spoofing is successful, the attacker receives all traffic destined for the client. Thus, an attacker can gain access to the network and take over the identity of a network user.

- If an administrator does not have adequate packet-sniffing skills, it is hard to defend against such intrusions. So, an expert ethical hacker and pen tester must know how to spoof MAC addresses, sniff network packets, and perform ARP poisoning, network spoofing, and DNS poisoning. This lab demonstrates how to spoof a MAC address to remain unknown to an attacker.
- We can use TMAC and SMAC tools to perform MAC spoofing.
