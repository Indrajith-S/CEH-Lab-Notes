- OmniPeek Network Analyzer provides real-time visibility and expert analysis of each part of the target network. It performs analysis, drills down, and fixes performance bottlenecks across multiple network segments. It includes analytic plug-ins that provide targeted visualization and search abilities.

- An ethical hacker or pen tester can use this tool to monitor and analyze network traffic of the target network in real-time, identify the source location of that traffic, and attempt to obtain sensitive information as well as find any network loopholes.

- Open Omnipeek
- Click on the **New Capture** option from the Omnipeek’s main screen to create an Omnipeek capture window.
- The **Capture Options** window appears; by default, the **Adapter** option opens-up.
- Under the **Adapter** section in the right-hand pane, expand the **Local machine: WINDOWS 10** node, select **Ethernet2**, and click **OK**.
- The **Capture 1** tab appears; click the **Start Capture** button in the right-hand corner of the window to begin capturing packets.
- The **Start Capture** button changes to read “**Stop Capture**” and traffic statistics begin to populate **Network** under the **Dashboards** section.
- If any activity is performed in the target machine, it will be recorded in Omnipeek.
- The captured statistical analysis of the data is displayed in the **Capture 1** tab of the navigation bar.
- You can observe the network traffic along with the websites visited by the target machine.
- To view the captured packets, select **Packets** under the **Capture** section in the left-hand pane. You can observe the outgoing and incoming network packets of the target system.
- You can further click the **Show Decode View** and **Show Hex View** icons to view detailed information regarding any selected packet.
- Click **Events** under the **Capture** section in the left-hand pane to view the events occurring in the network.
- Click **Clients/Servers** under the **Expert** section in the left-hand pane to view a list of active systems in the local network.
- Similarly, under the **Flows** and **Applications** options, you can view the packet flow and applications running on the systems in the local network.
- Click on **Clients** under the **Web** section in the left-hand pane to view the active systems in the network.
- Click **Peer Map** under the **Visuals** section in the left-hand pane to show a mapped view of the network traffic. By default, all **Traffic Types** (**Unicast**, **Multicast**, and **Broadcast**) are selected.
	- You can select any traffic according to your purpose.
- Similarly, under the **Visuals** section, you can click the **Graphs** option to show graphs on packet size, QoS analysis, TCP analysis, TCP vs. UDP, and web protocols.
- Click on the **Summary** option under the **Statistics** section in the left-hand pane to view a summary report of the network analysis.
- Click **File** from the menu bar and click **Save Report…** to save the report.


- In real-time, an attacker may perform this analysis to obtain sensitive information as well as to find any loopholes in the network.
