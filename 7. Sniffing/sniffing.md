- Now, as an ethical hacker or pen tester, it is important to understand network sniffing. Packet sniffing allows a person to observe and access the entire network’s traffic from a given point. It monitors any bit of information entering or leaving the network. There are two types of sniffing: passive and active. Passive sniffing refers to sniffing on a hub-based network; active sniffing refers to sniffing on a switch-based network.
- Attackers hack the network using sniffers, where they mainly target the protocols vulnerable to sniffing. Some of these vulnerable protocols include HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP, Telnet, IMAP, and NNTP. The sniffed traffic comprises data such as FTP and Telnet passwords, chat sessions, email and web traffic, and DNS traffic. Once attackers obtain such sensitive information, they might attempt to impersonate target user sessions.

- Thus, an ethical hacker or pen tester needs to assess the security of the network’s infrastructure, find the loopholes in the network using various network auditing tools, and patch them up to ensure a secure network environment.
