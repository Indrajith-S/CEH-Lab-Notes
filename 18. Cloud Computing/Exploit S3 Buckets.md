#### Overview of S3 Buckets
- S3 buckets are used by customers and end users to store text documents, PDFs, videos, images, etc. To store all these data, the user needs to create a bucket with a unique name.

- Listed below are several techniques that can be adopted to identify AWS S3 Buckets:

	- **Inspecting HTML**: Analyze the source code of HTML web pages in the background to find URLs to the target S3 buckets
	- **Brute-Forcing URL**: Use Burp Suite to perform a brute-force attack on the target bucket’s URL to identify its correct URL
	- **Finding subdomains**: Use tools such as Findsubdomains and Robtex to identify subdomains related to the target bucket
	- **Reverse IP Search**: Use search engines such as Bing to perform reverse IP search to identify the domains of the target S3 buckets
	- **Advanced Google hacking**: Use advanced Google search operators such as **“inurl”** to search for URLs related to the target S3 buckets


### Exploit Open S3 Buckets using AWS CLI

- The AWS command line interface (CLI) is a unified tool for managing AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.
	- Before starting this task, you must create your AWS account (**https://aws.amazon.com**).
- Open Terminal
	> sudo su
	> cd
	> pip3 install awscli (to install AWS CLI
	> aws configure (to configure AWS CLI)
	
	- provide the following by going to your aws account and navigating to security credentials
	- In the **Default region name** field, type **eu-west-1** and press **Enter**.
	- The **Default output format** prompt appears; leave it as default and press **Enter**.
- For demonstration purposes, we have created an open S3 bucket with the name **certifiedhacker1** in the AWS service. We are going to use that bucket in this task.
	- The public S3 buckets can be found during the enumeration phase.
- Let us list the directories in the certifiedhacker1 bucket.
	> aws s3 ls s3:// #bucketname
	- This will show you the list of directories in the certifiedhacker1 S3 bucket.
	- browse to **certifiedhacker1.s3.amazonaws.com** in chrome.
	- This will show you the complete list of directories and files available in this bucket.

	> aws s3 mv Hack.txt s3://certifiedhacker1 (to move the **Hack.txt** file to the **certifiedhacker1** bucket)

	> aws s3 rm s3://certifiedhacker1/Hack.txt (to delete Hack.txt file from s3 bucket)
	- To verify whether the file is deleted, switch to the browser window and reload the page.
	- Thus, you can add or delete files from open S3 buckets.
