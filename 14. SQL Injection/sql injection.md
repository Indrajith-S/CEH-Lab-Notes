- SQL injection attacks can be performed using various techniques to view, manipulate, insert, and delete data from an applicationâ€™s database. There are three main types of SQL injection:
	- **In-band SQL injection**: An attacker uses the same communication channel to perform the attack and retrieve the results
	- **Blind/inferential SQL injection**: An attacker has no error messages from the system with which to work, but rather simply sends a malicious SQL query to the database    
	- **Out-of-band SQL injection**: An attacker uses different communication channels (such as database email functionality, or file writing and loading functions) to perform the attack and obtain the results
