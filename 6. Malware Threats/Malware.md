- Malware poses a major security threat to information security. Malware writers explore new attack vectors to exploit vulnerabilities in information systems. This leads to ever more sophisticated malware attacks, including drive-by malware, “maladvertising” (or “malvertising”) and advanced persistent threats. Although organizations try hard to defend themselves using comprehensive security policies and advanced anti-malware controls, the current trend indicates that malware applications are targeting “lower-hanging fruit”; these include unsecured smartphones, mobile applications, social media, and cloud services. This problem is further complicated, because of the challenges faced during threat prediction.
- With the help of a malicious application (malware), an attacker gains access to stored passwords in a computer and is able to read personal documents, delete files, display pictures, or messages on the screen, slow down computers, steal personal information, send spam, and commit fraud. Malware can perform various malicious activities that range from simple email advertising to complex identity theft and password stealing.
- Programmers develop malware and use it to:

	- Attack browsers and track websites visited
	- Affect system performance, making it very slow
	- Cause hardware failure, rendering computers inoperable
	- Steal personal information, including contacts
	- Erase valuable information, resulting in substantial data losses
	- Attack additional computer systems directly from a compromised system
	- Spam inboxes with advertising emails
