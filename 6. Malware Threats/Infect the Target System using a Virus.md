- Viruses are the scourges of modern computing. Computer viruses have the potential to wreak havoc on both business and personal computers. The lifetime of a virus depends on its ability to reproduce. Therefore, attackers design every virus code in such a manner that the virus replicates itself n number of times, where n is a number specified by the attacker. Worldwide, most businesses have been infected by a virus at some point. Like a biological virus, a computer virus is contagious and can contaminate other files; however, viruses can only infect outside machines with the assistance of computer users.

- Like viruses, computer worms are standalone malicious programs that independently replicate, execute, and spread across network connections, without human intervention. Worms are a subtype of virus. Intruders design most worms to replicate and spread across a network, thus consuming available computing resources and, in turn, causing network servers, web servers, and individual computer systems to become overloaded and stop responding. However, some worms also carry a payload to damage the host system.

- An ethical hacker and pen tester during an audit of a target organization must determine whether viruses and worms can damage or steal the organization’s information. They might need to construct viruses and worms and try to inject them into the target network to check their behaviour, learn whether an anti-virus will detect them, and find out whether they can bypass the firewall.


### Create a Virus using the JPS Virus Maker Tool and Infect the Target System

- The JPS Virus Maker tool is used to create its own customized virus. This tool has many options for building that can be used to create a virus. Some of the tool’s features are auto-start, shutdown, disable security center, lock mouse and keyboard, destroy protected storage, and terminate windows. An ethical hacker and pen-tester can use the JPS Virus Maker Tool as a proof of concept to audit perimeter security controls in an organization.
- Navigate to **Virus Maker\JPS Virus Maker** and double-click **jps.exe**.
- The window displays various features and options that can be chosen while creating a virus file.
- From the **Virus Options**, check the **options** that you want to embed in a new virus file.
- In this lab, the options embedded in the virus file are **Disable TaskManager**, **Disable Windows Update**, **Disable Control Panel**, **Disable Drives**, **Hide Windows Clock**, **Hide Desktop Icons**, **Enable Remote Desktop**, **Remove Bluetooth**, **Turn Off Windows Firewall**, **Turn Off Windows Defender**, and **Auto Startup**.
- Ensure that the **None** radio button is selected to specify the trigger event when the virus should start attacking the system after its creation.
- Now, before clicking on **Create Virus!**, click the right arrow icon from the right-hand pane of the window to configure the virus options.
- A **Virus Options** window appears. 
- Check the **Change Windows Password** option, and enter a password (here, **qwerty**) in the text field. Check the **Change Computer Name** option, and type **Test** in the text field.
- You can even configure the virus to convert to a worm. To do this, check the **Enable Convert to Worm** checkbox, and provide a **Worm Name** (here, **fedevi**). For the worm to self-replicate after a particular time, specify the time in seconds (here, **1 second**) in the **Copy After** field.
- Ensure that the **JPG Icon** radio button is selected under the **Change Icon** section. Ensure that the **None** radio button is selected in the lower part of the window.
- After completing your selection of options, click the drop-down icon next to the **Create Virus!** button and select **x86(32Bit)**; click **Create Virus!**.
- The newly created virus (server) is placed automatically in the **folder** where jps.exe is located, but with the name **Server.exe**. Navigate to **D:\CEH-Tools\CEHv11 Module 07 Malware Threats\Virus Maker\JPS Virus Maker** and observe that the newly created virus with the name **Server.exe** is available at the specified location.
- Now, pack this virus with a binder or virus packager and send it to the victim machine through email, chat, a mapped network drive, or other method.
- Now log into the target machine as a victim.
- Surprised by the system behaviour, the victim (you) attempts to fix the machine by restarting it. Once the machine has rebooted, try to log in to the machine with the provided **Username** and **Password**. You should receive the error message “the password is incorrect. Try again.”
- Now, login with the password that you provided at the time of virus creation (i.e., **qwerty**). You should log in to the machine with the new password.
- You will get a similar error for all the applications that are disabled by the virus.
