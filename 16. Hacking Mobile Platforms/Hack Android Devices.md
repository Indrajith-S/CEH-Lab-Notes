- Owing to the increase in the number of users with Android devices, they have become the primary targets for hackers. Attackers use various Android hacking tools to discover vulnerabilities in the platform, and then exploit them to carry out attacks such as DoS, Man-in-the-Disk, and Spear phone attacks.
