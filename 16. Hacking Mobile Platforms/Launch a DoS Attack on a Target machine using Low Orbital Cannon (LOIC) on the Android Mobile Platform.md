- Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) is an open-source network stress testing and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack application. LOIC performs a DoS attack (or when used by multiple individuals, a DDoS attack) on a target site by flooding the server with TCP or UDP packets with the intention of disrupting the service of a particular host. People have used LOIC to join voluntary botnets.

- In this task, we will use LOIC on the Android mobile platform to launch a DoS attack on a target machine.
- Download and click the **Low Orbit Ion Cannon LOIC_v1.3.apk** file.
- A **Do you want to install this application?** screen appears, click **INSTALL**.
- The installation begins; on completion, an **App installed** notification appears; click **OPEN** to launch the app.
- In the left pane, in the URL field, type #targetip and click the **GET IP** button.
- To launch the attack, first select the **TCP** radio button; in the right pane, enter **80** as the **Port** number and in the **Threads** field, enter **100**. Then, click the **Start** button.
- LOIC begins to flood the target website with TCP packets.
- You can experience a degrade in a performance of the target machine.
