- As a professional ethical hacker or pen tester, your next step in hacking wireless networks is to capture and analyze the traffic of the target wireless network.

- This wireless traffic analysis will help you to determine the weaknesses and vulnerable devices in the target network. In the process, you will determine the network’s broadcasted SSID, the presence of multiple access points, the possibility of recovering SSIDs, the authentication method used, WLAN encryption algorithms, etc.

### Wi-Fi Packet Analysis using Wireshark

- Wireshark is a network protocol sniffer and analyzer. It lets you capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a target network. Wireshark can read live data from Ethernet, Token-Ring, FDDI, serial (PPP and SLIP), and 802.11 wireless LAN. Npcap is a library that is integrated with Wireshark for complete WLAN traffic analysis, visualization, drill-down, and reporting. Wireshark can be used in monitor mode to capture wireless traffic. It is able to capture a vast number of management, control, data frames, etc. and further analyze the Radiotap header fields to gather critical information such as protocols and encryption techniques used, length of the frames, MAC addresses, etc.
-  802.11 protocol indicates wireless packets.
- You can access the saved packet capture file anytime, and by issuing packet filtering commands in the Filter field, you can narrow down the packet search in an attempt to find packets containing sensible information.
- In real time, attackers enforce packet capture and packet filtering techniques to capture packets containing passwords (only for websites implemented on HTTP channel), perform attacks such as session hijacking, and so on.
