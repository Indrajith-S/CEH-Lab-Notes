- To open nikto go to 
	- Application --> Pentesting --> Web Application analysis --> Web Vulnerability Scanners --> nikto 
- We will use the **Tuning** option to do a deeper and more comprehensive scan on the target webserver
	- A tuning scan can be used to decrease the number of tests performed against a target. By specifying the type of test to include or exclude, faster and focused testing can be completed. This is useful in situations where the presence of certain file types such as XSS or simply “interesting” files is undesired.

> nikto -h #targetWebsite - Tuning x 

	- **-h**: specifies the target host and **x**: specifies the Reverse Tuning Options (i.e., include all except specified).
	- The result appears, displaying various information such as the name of the server, IP address, target port, retrieved files, and vulnerabilities details of the target website.

- Now, we will save the scan results in the form of a text file.
> cd Desktop
> nikto -h #targetWebsite -o #fileName -F txt 
> pluma #fileName.txt


	- **-h**: specifies the target, **-o**: specifies the name of the output file, and **-F**: specifies the file format.
