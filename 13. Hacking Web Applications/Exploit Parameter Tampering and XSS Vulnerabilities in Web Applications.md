- Parameter tampering is a simple form of attack aimed directly at an application’s business logic. A parameter tampering attack exploits vulnerabilities in integrity and logic validation mechanisms that may result in XSS or SQL injection exploitation.

- XSS attacks exploit vulnerabilities in dynamically generated web pages, which enables malicious attackers to inject client-side script into web pages viewed by other users. Attackers inject malicious JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash code for execution on a victim’s system by hiding it within legitimate requests.

- Although implementing a strict application security routine, parameters, and input validation can minimize parameter tampering and XSS vulnerabilities, many websites and web applications are still vulnerable to these security threats.

- Attacking web applications through parameter tampering and XSS vulnerabilities is one of the steps an attacker takes in attempting to compromise a web application’s security. An expert ethical hacker and pen tester should be aware of the different parameter tampering and XSS methods that can be employed by an attacker to hack web applications.

- Here, we will learn how to exploit parameter tampering and XSS vulnerabilities in the target web application.

1. Click [Windows 10](https://labclient.labondemand.com/Instructions/9baf6657-1025-452d-b133-7e88ffcb9dd2?rc=10#) to switch to the **Windows 10** machine.
    
2.  Launch any browser, in this lab we are using **Mozilla Firefox**. In the address bar of the browser place your mouse cursor and click http://www.moviescope.com and press **Enter**.
    
3.  The **MovieScope** website appears. In the **Login** form, type **Username** and **Password** as **steve** and **password**, and click **Login**.
    
    > Here, we are logging in as a registered user on the website.

4.  You are logged into the website. Click the **View Profile** tab from the menu bar.
    
    ![222223333.png](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab73327/222223333.png)
    
5.  You will be redirected to the profile page, which displays the personal information of **steve** (here, you). You will observe that the value of **ID** in the personal information and address bar is **4**.

6.  Now, try to change the parameter in the address bar to **id=1** and press **Enter**.
    
7.  You will be redirected to the profile of **sam** without having to perform any hacking techniques to explore the database. Here, you can observe Sam’s personal information under the **View Profile** tab, as shown in the screenshot.
    
    ![MMMMMMMMMMM.png](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab73327/MMMMMMMMMMM.png)
    
8.  Now, try the parameter **id=3** in the address bar and press **Enter**.
    
9.  You get the profile for **kety**. This way, you can change the id number and obtain profile information for different users.
    
    > This process of changing the ID value and getting the result is known as parameter tampering. Web XSS attacks exploit vulnerabilities on dynamically generated web pages. This enables malicious attackers to inject client-side scripts into the web pages viewed by other users.

10.  Now, click the **Contacts** tab. Here you will be performing an XSS attack.
    
11.  The **Contacts** page appears; enter your name or any random name (here, **steve**) in the **Name** field; enter the cross-site script as shown in the screenshot in the **Comment** field and click the **Submit Comment** button.
12.  On this page, you are testing for XSS vulnerability. Now, refresh the **Contacts** page.

13.  You have successfully added a malicious script to this page. The comment with the malicious link is stored on the server.
    
14.  Click [Windows Server 2019](https://labclient.labondemand.com/Instructions/9baf6657-1025-452d-b133-7e88ffcb9dd2?rc=10#) to switch to the **Windows Server 2019** machine. Click [Ctrl+Alt+Delete](https://labclient.labondemand.com/Instructions/9baf6657-1025-452d-b133-7e88ffcb9dd2?rc=10#) to activate the machine, by default, **Administrator** account is selected, click Pa$$w0rd to enter the password and press **Enter**.

15. Launch any browser, in this lab we are using **Google Chrome**. In the address bar of the browser place your mouse cursor and click http://www.moviescope.com and press **Enter**.
    
16. The **MovieScope** website appears. In the **Login** form, type the **Username** and **Password** as **sam** and **test** and click **Login**.
    
    > Here, we are logging in as the victim.

17. You are logged into the website as a legitimate user. Click the **Contacts** tab from the menu bar.
    
18. As soon as you click the **Contacts** tab, the cross-site script running on the backend server is executed, and a pop-up appears, stating, **You are hacked**.

19. Similarly, whenever a user attempts to visit the **Contacts** page, the alert pops up as soon as the page is loaded.
