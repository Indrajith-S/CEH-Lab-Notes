#### Overview of Footprinting the Web Infrastructure

- Footprinting the web infrastructure allows attackers to engage in the following tasks:

	- **Server Discovery**: Attackers attempt to discover the physical servers that host a web application using techniques such as Whois Lookup, DNS Interrogation, and Port Scanning
	- **Service Discovery**: Attackers discover services running on web servers to determine whether they can use some of them as attack paths for hacking a web app
	- **Server Identification**: Attackers use banner-grabbing to obtain server banners; this helps to identify the make and version of the web server software
	- **Hidden Content Discovery**: Footprinting also allows attackers to extract content and functionality that is not directly linked to or reachable from the main visible content.
